# Machine Learning Sandbox

Machine learning, AI, and probability form a side of programming / CS that I'm currently unfamilar with. To fix this, I will endeavor to learn the tools, techniques, etc., in this field. As per usual, I will document my learning process via journals and associated code in this repo

## Goals

Get comfortable with machine learning, probability, statistics, and ultimately apply that knowledge to automate everything I currently do. Obviously, this is going to be a long running task that will take truly years.

### 1 - Setup Alchemy Locally

Markov Logic Networks, as according to professor Pedro Domingos, is a good entry point for the universal learner; I will start my journey to machine learning by running through his tutorials on it. See [full journal entry here](./packages/journal/1-alchemy-setup.md)
