# Machine Learning Sandbox

Machine learning, AI, and probability form a side of programming / CS that I'm currently unfamilar with. To fix this, I will endeavor to learn the tools, techniques, etc., in this field. As per usual, I will document my learning process via journals and associated code in this repo

## Goals

Get comfortable with machine learning, probability, statistics, and ultimately apply that knowledge to automate everything I currently do. Obviously, this is going to be a long running task that will take truly years.

### 1 - Setup Alchemy Locally

Markov Logic Networks, as according to professor Pedro Domingos, is a good entry point for the universal learner; I will start my journey to machine learning by running through his tutorials on it. See [full journal entry here](./packages/journal/1-alchemy-setup.md)

TODOs

- [ ] Try doing this on a linux box
- [ ] Figure out why compilation fails on macOS

### 2 - Start to Learn Jison

Although I have no real hard evidence, my inner support vector machine is drawing an analogy between machine learning and language construction. Now, I know next to nothing about how to construct a language, so I want to fix this by learning how to use bison to construct a language. See [first journal entry here](./packages/journal/2-start-jison.md)

### ? - Parse and Setup Video Streams

One obvious application of ML is to process images and streams of images (aka video) for the purposes of automating game-playing or web surfing. I would like to use something like [libsdl](https://www.libsdl.org/) to stream-capture and process in hopes of furthering the ultimate goal to build a machine that can do my job
