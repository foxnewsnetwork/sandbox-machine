# Getting Started With Jison

Naturally, as I learn more about computer science, I would need to learn more computer languages; and using [jison][1] to build some basic calculator or compiler would be a great way to get my feet wet in the world of programming languages. This journal entry will be my first foray into building a compiler that translates a language into javascript. 

The ultimate goal of this project would be the creation of a ML-enabled meta-compiler that puts together to-js application-specific compilers. The code for this lives [here](../ailang)

# Basic Calculator

First things first, I want to get a "hello world" example going by setting up my local environment to be able to work. Following the directions on the [jison github landing page][4], I will attempt to follow along with the [calculator example][5]
